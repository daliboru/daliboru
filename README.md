I am a software developer who values transparency, continuous improvement and creating products with care and dedication. My approach to development focuses on finding solutions to problems rather than simply adding new features. I also tend to over-architect and underbuild (Iâ€™m hoping for the best but planning for the worst). As a software developer, my goal is to be proficient in a wide range of technologies and not be limited to any specific stack or framework. That being said, I have the most experience working with React, React Native, and Node.js.

I have a strong interest in extreme programming (XP) and test-driven development (TDD) because I believe these tools lead to the most durable and cost-effective solutions.
