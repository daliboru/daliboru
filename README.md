TLDR: I love to optimise and build startups.

Dalibor has a diverse background in product management and full-stack development, with significant experience leading cross-functional teams and launching successful products. 

At the beginning of his career, as the founder of Kulturni Automat +, Dalibor scaled a startup and drove innovative solutions in the cultural sector. Later, in other positions, he managed product development, implemented *true* Agile methodologies, and delivered user-centric platforms. His expertise spans strategic planning, market research, and continuous integration, consistently aligning product outcomes with business objectives.
